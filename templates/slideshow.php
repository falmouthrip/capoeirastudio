				<p>Falmouth Cemetery has been neglected.  The cemetery is overgrown.  Falmouth is in a period of such economic difficulty, that people are forced build shacks in the cemetery using the graves as flooring.  Relatives are unable to find the graves of their loved ones.</p>
				<p>On the odd occasions when families raise funds to clear the cemetery, wild goats eat the flowers laid on the graves of those who have passed.</p>
				<p>Falmouth Cemetary contains the remains of generations of Jamaicans, from the times of slavery, through the struggle for independence, to date.  It is a national treasure, and we owe it to our ancestors to ensure they have a sacred and beautiful resting place.</p>
